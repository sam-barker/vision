## Commiting
All commit messages should be done through [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli),
which is configured to use the cz-conventional-changelog adapter. These are installed locally
through dev dependencies.

To commit through Commitizen, just run `yarn cm`. The flags and commands are the same as
traditional `git commit`.

This enforces proper semantic versioning and releasing with CI.
